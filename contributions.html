This paper presents the design and experimental
evaluations of an articulated robotic leg. The main scope
of this new design is to combine high payload capabilities
with agile locomotion. While both high payloads and agility
have been achieved individually by different walking robots,
designs intended for both have not been proposed yet. We
optimized pseudo-direct-drive actuators to provide high torques
density while simultaneously having good efficiency, low heat
generation, and sufficient velocity to address the challenge. A
two-DOF leg prototype has been designed and manufactured.
The experimental test setup for the leg prototype is explained,
and the results of the first hopping experiments are reported.

Terrain geometry is, in general, non-smooth, nonlinear, non-convex, and, if perceived through a robot-centric
visual unit, appears partially occluded and noisy. This work
presents the complete control pipeline capable of handling the
aforementioned problems in real-time. We formulate a trajectory
optimization problem that jointly optimizes over the base pose
and footholds, subject to a heightmap. To avoid converging into
undesirable local optima, we deploy a graduated optimization
technique. We embed a compact, contact-force free stability
criterion that is compatible with the non-flat ground formulation.
Our experiments demonstrate stair climbing, walking on stepping
stones, and over gaps, utilizing various dynamic gaits.

The Whole-Body Locomotion Framework (WoLF)
is an end-to-end software suite devoted to the loco-manipulation
of quadruped robots. WoLF abstracts the complexity of planning and control of quadrupedal robot hardware into a simple
to use and robust software that can be connected through multiple tele-operation devices to different quadruped robot models.
Furthermore, WoLF allows controlling mounted devices, such
as arms or pan-tilt cameras, jointly with the quadrupedal
platform. In this short paper, we introduce the main features
of WoLF and its overall software architecture.

<strong>[4] Legged Navigation Planning in the DARPA Subterranean Challenge (Original Work)</strong><br>

Navigation planning for legged robots has distinct
challenges compared to wheeled and tracked systems due to
the ability to lift legs off the ground and step over obstacles.
While most navigation planners assume a fixed traversability
value for a single terrain patch, we had previously proposed a
reachability-based navigation planner for legged robots, which
approximates the robot morphology by a set of reachability and
body volumes. It uses a learned convolutional neural network
to restrict valid footholds to feasible regions and incrementally
builds a probabilistic roadmap graph for fast planning queries.
We extend this work using an additional neural network trained
in simulation, which predicts locomotion cost and risk over
a given terrain. This produces safe and low-cost paths and
increases planning speed by leveraging batched processing
of the cost prediction network on GPU to rapidly validate
navigation graph edges through locomotion risk thresholding.
We deployed this navigation planner in team CERBERUSâ€™
winning entry to the DARPA Subterranean Challenge finals,
where the proposed planner powered the local navigation of
four ANYmal quadrupeds during all three competition runs
without a single navigation failure.

<strong>[6] Dynamic Walking with Footstep Adaptation on the MIT Humanoid via Linear Model Predictive Control (Recent Work)</strong><br>

<button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#paper6">Abstract and Paper</button>
<div id="paper6" class="collapse section-subheading-contrib">
 This paper proposes a model predictive control
(MPC) framework for realizing dynamic walking gaits on the
MIT Humanoid. In addition to adapting footstep location and
timing online, the proposed method can reason about varying
height, contact wrench, torso rotation, kinematic limit and
negotiating uneven terrains. Specifically, a linear MPC (LMPC)
optimizes for the desired footstep location by linearizing the
single rigid body dynamics with respect to the current footstep
location. A low-level task-space controller tracks the predicted
state and control trajectories from the LMPC to leverage the
full-body dynamics. Finally, an adaptive gait frequency scheme
is employed to modify the step frequency and enhance the
robustness of the walking controller. 
Both LMPC and taskspace control can be efficiently solved as quadratic programs
(QP), and thus amenable for real-time applications. Simulation
studies where the MIT Humanoid traverses a wave field and
recovers from impulsive disturbances validated the proposed
approach.

<strong>[7] Wild ANYmal: Learning Robust Perceptive Locomotion (Recent Work)</strong><br>

Legged robots that can operate autonomously
in remote and hazardous environments will greatly increase
opportunities for exploration into under-explored areas. Exteroceptive perception is crucial for fast and energy-efficient
locomotion: perceiving the terrain before making contact with
it enables planning and adaptation of the gait ahead of time to
maintain speed and stability. However, utilizing exteroceptive
perception robustly for locomotion has remained a grand
challenge in robotics. Snow, vegetation, and water visually
appear as obstacles on which the robot cannot step â€“ or
are missing altogether due to high reflectance. Additionally,
depth perception can degrade due to difficult lighting, dust,
fog, reflective or transparent surfaces, sensor occlusion, and
more. For this reason, the most robust and general solutions
to legged locomotion to date rely solely on proprioception.
This severely limits locomotion speed, because the robot has
to physically feel out the terrain before adapting its gait
accordingly. Here we present a robust and general solution
to integrating exteroceptive and proprioceptive perception for
legged locomotion. We leverage an attention-based recurrent
encoder that integrates proprioceptive and exteroceptive input.
The encoder is trained end-to-end and learns to seamlessly
combine the different perception modalities without resorting
to heuristics. The result is a legged locomotion controller with
high robustness and speed.

<strong>[8] Loco-Manipulation Planning for Legged Robots: Offline and Online Strategies (Recent Work)</strong><br>

The deployment of robots within realistic environments requires the capability to plan and refine the locomanipulation trajectories on the fly to avoid unexpected interactions with a dynamic environment. This extended abstract
provides a pipeline to offline plan a configuration space global
trajectory based on a randomized strategy, and to online locally
refine it depending on any change of the dynamic environment
and the robot state. The offline planner directly plans in the
contact space, and additionally seeks for whole-body feasible
configurations compliant with the sampled contact states. The
planned trajectory, made by a discrete set of contacts and
configurations, can be seen as a graph and it can be online
refined during the execution of the global trajectory. The online
refinement is carried out by a graph optimization planner
exploiting visual information. It locally acts on the global initial
plan to account for possible changes in the environment. While
the offline planner is a concluded work, tested on the humanoid
COMAN+, the online local planner is still a work-in-progress
which has been tested on a reduced model of the CENTAURO
robot to avoid dynamic and static obstacles interfering with a
wheeled motion task. Both the COMAN+ and the CENTAURO
robots have been designed at the Italian Institute of Technology
(IIT).

In this paper, we introduce a two-step calibration
routine to identify the planar center of mass (CoM) position and
the effective centroidal dynamics parameters of any quadruped

A bisection search method is used to locate the position of
the planar CoM, and a sinusoidal excitation method is used
to extract moments of inertia about each body axis. We verifu
the inertial parameter identification method in simulation, and
we implemented the center of mass finding algorithm in both

<strong>[10] A Lie Algebraic Model Predictive Control for Legged Robot Control: Implementation and Stability Analysis (Recent Work)</strong><br>

Rigid body model has been widely adopted to
plan the centroidal motion of legged robot. However, the
rigid body motion evolves on the SE(3) manifold, which is
nonlinear and not trivial to parameterize. The existing Model
Predictive Control (MPC) either uses local parameterization
that suffers from singularities, or geometric based liearization
that makes the problem state dependent or hard to vectorize.
In this work, we focus on the MPC on matrix Lie group.
We linearize the configuration error and design a quadratic
cost function in its Lie algebra. Given an initial condition, the
linearized configuration error dynamics is globally valid and
evolve independently of the system trajectory. The quadratic
cost function could also ensure exponential convergence rate.
The proposed MPC has been experimentally validated in MIT
mini Cheetah locomotion and pose control.

<strong>[12] Neck Design for Robust Visual-Inertial State Estimation during Aggressive Locomotion with Dynamic Vibration Absorber (Original Work)</strong><br>

<button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#paper12">Abstract and Paper</button>
<div id="paper12" class="collapse section-subheading-contrib">
We propose a new neck design of legged robots
to achieve robust visual-inertial state estimation in dynamic
locomotion. Our neck design absorbs the impact from the
legs and reduces the periodic vertical movement of the head
using the dynamic vibration absorber (DVA), which can readily
adapt to the frequency of oscillation of the body. Due to this
smooth movement of the head, sensors in the head can measure
data stably, which is impossible when sensors are directly
attached to the body. We present the mechanical design of the
neck as a combination of suspension mechanism with dynamic
vibration absorber, which provide an adjustable notch filter for
the vertical motion of the robot. Simulation and experimental
results are performed to verify the effect of the proposed neck
on the head of robots, manifesting that the states estimated
from the visual-inertial sensors on the head can be precise
even during aggressive motion by rendering both the inertial
information and the feature tracking more stable and robust.
The presented design can overcome the disadvantage that the
localization of robots with legs can only operate well in gentle
locomotion.

In this paper, we introduce a Model Predictive
Control (MPC) formulation that calculates the ground reaction forces and torques for a quadruped equipped with two
reaction wheels. We augment the centroidal dynamics with two
additional angular momentum states from the wheels, and we
further simplify the dynamics to formulate the problem as a
convex quadratic program. With the simplified dynamics, we
are able to run a hardware implementation of the MPC with a
ten-time-step horizon and close the control loop at 250 Hertz.
Experiment and simulation results demonstrate improved attitude stabilization and up to 40 percent reduction in angular
error. A video demonstration of some of the experiments is

Humanoid bipedal platforms are finally moving

substantial improvements in hardware and software architectures.

This abstract presents methods that reduce the
computational demand of including second-order dynamics
sensitivity information into optimization algorithms for robots
in contact with the environment. The work extends a previous
study on unconstrained whole-body motion planning. A full
second-order Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) algorithm is presented where all the necessary dynamics partial
derivatives are computed with lower computational complexity
than conventional DDP methods. Compared to using a firstorder approximation, the second-order partials more accurately
represent the dynamics locally, but since they are tensorial and
expensive to compute, they are often ignored. This work illustrates how to avoid the need for computing the derivative tensor
by instead leveraging reverse-mode accumulation of derivatives.
We also exploit the structure of the contact-constrained dynamics to further accelerate these computations. The relative
performance of the proposed approach is benchmarked on a
simulated model of the MIT Mini Cheetah executing a bounding

Online planning of whole-body motions for legged
robots is challenging due to the inherent nonlinearity in the
robot dynamics. To address this limitation, we propose a nonlinear MPC framework, the BiConMP, which can generate whole
body trajectories online by efficiently exploiting the structure
of the robot dynamics. BiConMP is used to generate various
cyclic gaits on a real quadruped robot and its performance
is evaluated on different terrain, countering unforeseen pushes
and transitioning online between different gaits. Further, we
demonstrate the ability of BiConMP to generate non-trivial
acyclic whole-body dynamic motions on the robot. Finally, an
extensive empirical analysis on the effects of planning horizon
and frequency on the nonlinear MPC framework is reported
and discussed.

for multiple platforms. Furthermore, the modular software
architecture allows researchers to experiment with their own
implementations of different components while leveraging the
existing framework. Quad-SDK also offers Gazebo simulation
support and a suite of visualization and data-processing tools
for rapid development. This work presents the high-level architecture of the software, its core features, and demonstrations
of the agile locomotion it enables.

<strong>[20] Reactive Locomotion Decision-Making and Robust Motion Planning for Real-Time Perturbation Recovery (Recent Work)</strong><br>

In this abstract, we examine the problem of push
recovery for bipedal robot locomotion and present a reactive
decision-making and robust planning framework for locomotion
resilient to external perturbations. Rejecting perturbations is
an essential capability of bipedal robots and has been widely
studied in the locomotion literature. However, adversarial
disturbances and aggressive turning can lead to negative lateral
step width (i.e., crossed-leg scenarios) with unstable motions
and self-collision risks. These motion planning problems are
computationally difficult and have not been explored under a
hierarchically integrated task and motion planning method. We
explore a planning and decision-making framework that closely
ties linear-temporal-logic-based reactive synthesis with trajectory optimization incorporating the robotâ€™s full-body dynamics,
kinematics, and leg collision avoidance constraints. Between
the high-level discrete symbolic decision-making and the lowlevel continuous motion planning, behavior trees serve as a
reactive interface to handle perturbations occurring at any time
of the locomotion process. Our experimental results show the
efficacy of our method in generating resilient recovery behaviors
in response to diverse perturbations from any direction with
bounded magnitudes.

Mathematical optimization is the workhorse be-
hind several aspects of modern robotics and control. In these
applications, the focus is on constrained optimization, and the
ability to work on manifolds (such as the classical matrix
Lie groups), along with a specific requirement for robustness
and speed. In recent years, augmented Lagrangian methods
have seen a resurgence due to their robustness and flexibility,
their connections to (inexact) proximal-point methods, and
their interoperability with Newton or semismooth Newton
methods. In the sequel, we present primal-dual augmented
Lagrangian method for inequality-constrained problems on
manifolds, which we introduced in our recent work, as well
as an efficient C++ implementation suitable for use in robotics
applications and beyond.

<strong>[22] Proprioception and Tail Control Enable Extreme Terrain Traversal by Quadruped Robots (Original Work)</strong><br>

Legged robotic systems leverage ground contact and
the reaction forces they provide to achieve agile locomotion.
However, uncertainty coupled with the discontinuous nature of
contact can lead to failure in real-world environments with
unexpected height variations, such as rocky hills or curbs. To
enable dynamic traversal of extreme terrain, this work introduces
the utilization of proprioception to estimate and react to unknown
hybrid events and elevation changes and a two-degree-of-freedom
tail to improve control independent of contact. Simulation results
over unforeseen elevation changes show that our method can
stabilize locomotion over height changes of up to 1.5 times the
leg length.

This paper tackles the problem of nonprehensile
object transportation through a legged manipulator. A wholebody control architecture is devised to prevent sliding of the
object placed on a tray-like end-effector and retain the legged
robot balance during walking. The controller solves a quadratic
optimization problem to realize the sought transportation task
while maintaining the contact forces between the tray and
the object and between the legs and the ground within their
respective friction cones.

Agile maneuvers such as sprinting and high-speed
turning in the wild are challenging for legged robots. Reinforcement learning provides a promising framework for addressing
this challenge. We present an end-to-end learned controller that
achieves record agility for the MIT Mini Cheetah, sustaining
speeds up to 3.9 m/s. This system runs and turns fast on
natural terrains like grass, ice, and gravel and responds robustly
to disturbances. Our controller is a neural network trained
in simulation via reinforcement learning and transferred to
the real world. The two key components are: (i) an adaptive
curriculum on velocity commands; and (ii) an online system
identification strategy for sim-to-real transfer leveraged from
prior work. Videos of the robotâ€™s behaviors are available at:

In this extended abstract we give a brief
introduction to our work [1]. We propose a foothold evaluation
criterion that considers the transition feasibility for both linear
and angular dynamics to overcome complex scenarios. We
present convex and nonlinear formulations as a direct extension
of [2] in a receding-horizon fashion to take into account
also angular dynamics. The criterion is integrated with a
Vision-based Foothold Adaptation (VFA) strategy that considers
robot kinematics, leg collisions and terrain morphology. We
verify the validity of the selected footholds and of the generated
trajectories in simulation and experiments with the 90kg
quadruped robot HyQ.

Robotic exploration of celestial bodies has been
performed solely with wheeled systems until today, making access
to highly unstructured, compressible, and sloped areas very
challenging. On the other hand, walking robots have advanced
rapidly over the last decade and have reached a maturity level
where commercial applications have become viable. Thus, it
is only a matter of time until walking robots will be used to
explore so far unreachable regions of our solar system. In this
work, we showcase the recent advancements of our dynamically
walking legged systems for future planetary exploration missions.
In detail, we summarize our work performed on walking on
steep, granular slopes, low-gravity locomotion, robot-payload
integration and mission scenario execution. Finally, we showcase
several real-world deployments and our lessons learned from
the experiments.

<strong>[28] Combining Reinforcement Learning and Trajectory Optimization for Multi-Contact Motion Planning & Control of Quadrupedal Locomotion (Recent Work)</strong><br>

This work addresses the problem of multi-contact
motion planning for quadrupedal legged robots on non-flat
terrain. A common challenge in this domain is the selection of a
contact schedule (i.e. contact configurations and contact switching
event times) and respective sequences of foothold positions. Our
approach is centered on formulating Markov decision processes
using the evaluation of kinematic and dynamic feasibility criteria
in the form of linear programs and are used in place of physical
simulation. The resulting MDPs are solved using a policy-
gradient-based reinforcement learning algorithm. Specifically, we
train neural-network policies which generate reference foothold
positions, Center-of-Mass poses and velocities as well contact
switching timings. We evaluate our method in unstructured
environments using proprioceptive and exteroceptive sensory
input and on a suite of relevant terrain scenarios such as stairs,
gaps and stepping stones.
